# TW Complex

Repo with algorithms to divide ally villages into front and back in TW.

Underneath it is a problem of dividing a set of 2D points **A** according to the `min_radius` and `max_radius` distances from a set of other 2D points **B**, which can be solved most simply by counting the distances from each point in the first set **A** to all points in the second set **B** one by one.

# Instalation

```bash
pip install tw_complex
```

# Basic usage

```python
from tw_complex.brute import CDistBrute
import numpy as np

# The code for Example 1 below

points1 = np.random.rand(10000, 2) + [2, 0]
points2 = np.random.rand(15000, 2)
min_radius = 1.4
max_radius = 2

precise_front, precise_back = CDistBrute(
    ally_villages=points1,
    enemy_villages=points2,
    min_radius=min_radius,
    max_radius=max_radius,
).result()

```

# Examples (before -> after)

### Example 1

```bash
Ally: 10000 points
Enemy: 15000 points
min_radius: 1.4
max_radius: 2
```

### Example 2

```bash
Ally: 2500 points
Enemy: 6000 points
min_radius: 4
max_radius: 10
```

### Example 3

```bash
Ally: 20000 points
Enemy: 20000 points
min_radius: 20
max_radius: 60
```

### Example 4

```bash
Ally: 20000 points
Enemy: 20000 points
min_radius: 10
max_radius: 120
```

# Running locally

You will need to have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/rafsaf/tw-complex.git
cd tw-complex
poetry install

```

Code lives in `tw-complex` folder, and you may also test algorithms running in main folder

```
# In main folder
# eg. ~/Desktop/tw-complex

pytest
```

For CDistAndKNN it looks like

```python
# tests/test_cdist.py

from tw_complex.cdist import CDistAndKNN
import tests.utils as utils


def test_CDistAndKNN():
    utils.run_all_tests(CDistAndKNN, "CDistAndKNN", _precision=0.8, draw=True)

# Go with `draw=False` if you do not want to use pyplot to show diagrams
```

Some hardcoded tests are located in `tests/utils.py`, it uses brute force for calculating exact result, then compare it to given algorithm using basic maths. You can even compare it to brute force itself (eg. using diffrent `_precision`). For new test there should be another file in `tests/test_name_of_file_in_tw_complex_folder.py` with pretty much the same content as above.
